    <span i18n:translate="">We listen to music wherever we can.</span>

<p i18n:translate="" class="cs-red">We adore music.</p>

<p i18n:translate="">
    It is the way how we listen to music that differs, and it is the way how we acquire it that differs. We are paying for streams, we are buying downloads, CDs, vinyl and even more odd formats. We are cheering to live music and we are enjoying music at friends. There‘s all sorts of media we are listening to.
</p>

<p i18n:translate="">
    But it is one thing we share – we all want to support the artists in making their music. The music market by and large made us lose the fan-to-artist connection. DIY brought it back. DIY means social media. Technology helps core fans to keep track of artists they adore. Now let casual supporters come close and share music the same way – throw your cents in the artist‘s bin!
